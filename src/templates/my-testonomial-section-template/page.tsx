            As a dedicated web developer specializing in the MERN stack,
            particularly with expertise in React TypeScript, I have developed a
            deep proficiency in crafting scalable, high-performance web
            applications. My skill set spans a broad range of modern front-end
            technologies, including React, Next.js, TypeScript, HTML, CSS,
            Tailwind CSS, Shadcn, Radix UI, and Three.js, enabling me to build
            interactive, visually appealing, and user-centric interfaces.

            On the backend, I excel in Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, SQL, and
            TypeScript, ensuring robust server-side logic and seamless
            integration with databases. My knowledge extends to code management
            with Git and Azure, making me adept at handling version control,
            deployment pipelines, and maintaining a smooth CI/CD workflow.

            familiarity with DevOps practices and agile methodologies, using
            tools like Jira, enables me to streamline the development process,
            ensuring that every project is delivered on time and meets the
