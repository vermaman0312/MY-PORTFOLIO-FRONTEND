          "As a passionate web developer with a strong focus on the MERN stack,
          particularly in React TypeScript, I have honed my skills in building
          efficient, scalable, and user-friendly web applications. My experience
          extends beyond just development; I am proficient in ethical hacking
          using Kali Linux, which gives me a unique perspective on security and
          performance optimization. Additionally, I have a deep understanding of
          Git, Jira, and modern front-end technologies like Vue.js, Vite.js,
          Tailwind CSS, and MUI. I am also familiar with DevOps practices, which
          help me streamline the development process from code to deployment.
          Whether it's building robust applications or maintaining secure and
          optimized workflows, I strive to deliver high-quality results in every
          project."
